# Introduction

The Noodle Language is a visual programming language based on the findings of the paper ["Investigation into the criteria of embeddability of visual scripting languages within the domain of game development."](#). The main goal for this visual scripting implementation specification is it to provide a prototype for a visual scripting language that can embedded without much effort into an application. 

This collection of documents will discuss the core concepts of Noodle by following the result structure of the above mentioned paper. The paper found five major aspects that are potentially important when designing a language framework with embeddability in mind. The thesis defines them as follows: 

1. performance and the identified subcategories
2. mechanical aspects of embedding software and their respective subcategories
3. license
4. documentation,
5. tooling and workflow 

While we look into each of these aspects, we define what consequences it has for Noodle.

> This **Chapter** is basically a breakdown version of the mentioned paper ["Investigation into the criteria of embeddability of visual scripting languages within the domain of game development."](#) as well as the accompanying industry article published on [my blog](https://simonrenger.de/posts/).
