# License & Documentation

The game industry caters for many different platforms with different requirements, some are open source, some are not. Therefore, the license needs to be permissive since it is not always possible to open-source certain aspects of the entire codebase due to NDA regulations. This is the reason why Noodle will use the MIT license or the Apache License, Version 2.0, depending on the userâ€™s need.

Besides the license, a good documentation on how to embed the language into your game framework is needed. The research for the thesis ["Investigation into the criteria of embeddability of visual scripting languages within the domain of game development."](#) has shown that it is expected by users for some form of online documentation and samples to exist. Therefore, Noodle has this page for documentation and help.
